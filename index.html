                        <h4>blast of emotions</h4>
                        <p>The biggest question is... I have just too many questions, but... 
                          Why am I feeling insecure about Rex? Why... You are not...
                           Why am I the one who wants to talk to you? Why am I the one who always calls you?
                           
                           Why am I the one who is not in love with you but still waits for your calls and messages and all?
                            Why are you not the one? Like, even after I'm being confused, I'm not in love, I do all these shits, 
                          and you claim to be in love and not doing anything.
                           Why am I the one who's... Forget it. One time he says that he is not...
                           
                           You know, he doesn't consider himself human, he doesn't want to be part of all this shit...
                            And the next time, there was one time when he particularly made an excuse that that time he was very weak, his mentality got downgraded. 
                            He weakened himself and he asked me to give him an answer to whether I wanted to be with him or what.
                             And I was like, you know, you always say that you don't need an answer, you always say that you were just confessing and you don't need an answer,
                              it doesn't even matter what you say. So why are you asking me this right now?
                               And he said that maybe I am a human. He said that, you know, all this time he used to say, 
                               no, I'm not human, human. And then he was like, maybe I am a human, that's why I need an answer.
                                Sometimes he contradicts with his own ideas. I love when he... You know, I said that I love the feeling of... I once said to him that I love...
                                 that he loves me. And it was a whole mess. well maybe i can't explain it to him...i really don't know to to say..
                                I don't know. Maybe I'm gonna take an impulsive decision rather than a logical one. 
                                You know, he asked me to, he gave me two options. One was to go ahead with life, let's have no connections, let's move on from each other.
                                 And the second one was, let's be connected, we'll not talk. But then, because I gave him the, because I said this, I said a thing that I'm not mature enough to know whether I'm in love or not. 
                                 I need time, I need, this is the time when I have, I'm having hormonal changes and I don't wanna mistake love for some hormonal changes.
                                  So he said, when you will mature, let's, and if you find that you love me and all, then message me, I will respond. 
                                  So we'll basically not lose the connection, the contact, but we'll not talk. At this point, I just wanna say that, let's date. Let's be official so that I can ask you all the questions.  Or go and fuck yourself. Go ahead with your life.
                                   Let's talk every day or let's not talk. Nothing in middle. Either be completely mine or let me forget the idea that you can ever be mine. 
                                   Although I'm not ready for relationship, although this is not the time, although it will be online, I don't give a fuck.

                        <p>You know bbg, yesterday I was thinking about a lot of stuff. I remember doing something I would have never done. I mean, we're just friends, right? Although you love me, and although I say that I don't love you and I don't want to be in a relationship with you, I don't know why I searched this, about marriages and all. It's fucked up, but I was searching about the marriage features of Rajasthani weddings, and how much similar it is to what kind of wedding I go to. Crazy, right? Senior, see in which direction I'm going with my life. I'm not sure if you are proud of my decisions or not, but I'm sure you will support me. You know bbg is the kind of person who made me search these things, who made me blush and giggle and kick my legs and hair. He's a good person, and I can't believe that he's in my life...oh and the chatgpt approved hahaah !!!

                        <h4>next</h4>
                        <p>You know, I kind of asked him a lot to, you know, tell me why you love me, give me assurance, this and that, and he always created this environment that, if you will ask something, I will do it, you know, but sometimes I feel like, why am I asking? Like, it's not about asking too much, it's about why there is a need for me to ask him, why he can't always give me an assurance without asking, if you know what I mean. But then I feel like maybe it's too much, maybe that's how things are. I feel that he's being honest with me all the time, but then again I doubt it sometimes when he seems confused, like, I don't think he lied to me, but then I feel like lying is the most natural thing a human can do. I just don't trust that how can someone be this perfect. He's not perfect, he has flaws, but even after that. I don't know if he'll get close to another girl and feel the same or not, because, you know, let me share something, in his past relationship when he had a girlfriend, he talked with me, it was only chat, started related, but he talked. And although now he told me that even his ex used to read our chats, and she was free to read the chats of other girls, but it's funny that they broke up and I'm the next one he proposed. So me and his best friend, we were just casually saying that, okay, let's see after me who he would propose. I feel like what if we are in a relationship and he talked to one girl, and he also shared it to me, and I have the full access to view the chats, but after the breakup, what if she's the next one? </p>

                        <h4>random</h4>
                        <p>I was thinking of sharing this on call but I guess its good I mean I always knew this but I just think that I'm the very wrong person for everyone Like I am just always confused always delusional always annoying kind if I have to describe myself And I realized that because of my so called attachment issues with you I am making you suffer and also I am making myself miserable Like my mental peace is actually gone I can't focus on anything I don't know I just feel weird And I like you a lot Like a lot And we are not in a relationship so I can't say anything when you do something which I don't like And its okay from your side but I lose my mental peace thinking about it And there are a lot of times when I want to blame you when I feel like I am angry at you when I want to say a lot of things to you sometimes because of some things that you do But then I remember that we are just friends and that makes me sick.. . Because maybe from the day I told you that if you come here we will date I kind of assumed that we will date and I don't know what's going inside my little brain but its just not working properly.. . And I told you this even earlier that I check my phone snap whatsapp every possible place like I really check the drive that we made every single day just because I want to see if you have written something there I even check my emails like what if.. . And one thing I realized that you are just too good for me and I am just too bad for everyone.. . Your concept of love is different from mine because you know I haven't even found what true love is And I just can't digest the fact that how can you love someone and not text them or call them or you know point them out when they talk dry.. . Like I really don't get that concept of your love and which is fine because people have different thoughts.. . But I was born in this era and my concept of love revolves around what's going on I believe that if you love someone you can't live without texting them or you can't.. . I mean I feel like if you are in love with someone.. . You give them attention You don't ghost them You don't.. . Anyways I don't know why I'm explaining this to you but in short what I want to say is.. . This is wrong but I really don't understand how you think or how you do things And I don't even understand how I think and how I do things And.. . Arguing about the same thing every third day is exhausting and I don't want to do it I thought that we can be good friends and.. . Because I am a bitch I was not even able to.. . act like friends And I'm taking all the blame for it and.. . at the same time I think that.. . you were right We can't go back to friends And that's why.. . I think.. . I should let go of.. . any feelings any.. . emotions any connection that we had I think.. . its better for me.. . and for you.. . to just.. . go different ways And trust me its not because of you its because of me I am the bad one here I was the one who started everything Like all this messy part when you were ready to just be friends and.. . I messed up And now I was very frustrated And I'm very frustrated every time you don't get my sarcasm and every time you don't.. . try to cling onto me when you dont try to hold me when I say I'm going.. . Like 99 of the time I want you to say don't go but because of I don't know what your ego or whatever you have God complex you never stop me you never say don't go like I really don't like the fact that you understand me every time Why do you have to understand me every time Can't you be like every other person And then I get the realization that you always say that you are not like everyone else and then I get mad at myself that I always knew that you are not like everyone else so how can I expect you to be to act like everyone else but I am like everyone else so I need someone who is like everyone else like I need someone who stops me I need someone who say don't go thousand times when I say I wanna go I want someone who doesn't give up easily on me I want someone who can try a thousand times ten thousand times till I don't say yes and you are not that someone and that's not your fault but that's my fault because that's how I want in my life.. .

Prabhas you are one of the best people I have ever met in my life And that was one of the reasons why I never wanted to lose you Even.. I just wanted you to be in my life Doesn't matter As what Friends best friends whatever And I still don't want to lose you But I realized that we can never actually go back to what we were And that's the hardest part about writing this long message And don't even think I'm using ChatGPT I'm not using ChatGPT I would not say that I thought a lot before writing this or before making a decision but one thing which I knew for sure is if you can go without texting me without calling me for a whole day you can go on with your life live your life without doing the same Like I don't know how to say it but I don't know I'm so fucking mad at myself that I'm saying all these things Because I have told you a lot a lot of times all these things and it's completely fine for you to not do it because of course you're not my boyfriend but somewhere in my mind I was already thinking about getting in a relationship and that's why it hurts me every time you say that we're just friends which is true we are just friends but it makes me frustrated sometimes And I realized that you're just too good for me I never knew that someone can love me but you did and I still can't believe it trust me I still can't believe it that someone can love me Not because I have some inferiority complex but it's just that I never thought that I was lovable Anyways I don't know why I'm saying all these things As if this is my last message to you But who knows life is so unpredictable You never know what dorm or what new road I will take tomorrow You know I have mood swings every now and then...

Anyways I just wanna say that thank you for everything Thank you for.. Loving me Thank you for coming to Chandigarh Thank you for always listening to my stories Thank you for always motivating me Thank you for making me smile Thank you for being my best friend Thank you for everything you have done for me And I'm sorry Because.. I did waste your time I'm sorry for.. I can't remember all the things that I have done Bad And I'm sorry because I'm acting like this...</p>

                        <p>Okay, here is the news. Yesterday, I called my friend. Okay, now, let me start from the beginning. So, yesterday, we were having some do not talk kind of thing. Like, around 11 a.m., we had a convo, and he said, okay, bye, in the middle. Maybe he was frustrated. It's okay. I didn't message him. Neither he did. Around 10 p.m., I messaged him saying that I am deleting my Instagram, which is like not deleting it, just deleting the app. But I will not be, I will not reinstall it, even if you message me something like that. So, he was like, so, how will I contact you if I want to talk to you? I said, why you want to contact me? Aren't you busy? Because just before that, we had a convo, and he said, I'm a little busy. Like, okay, Mr. Busy, Mr. President. So, yeah, and something, something happened, and then he was like, that a couple of, my chapter is about to complete, then I will call you. And I didn't reply to that, and he actually called me. But at the time, I had my phone in my hand, but my mom was in front of me, so I was not willing to pick it up. I called him after some time, and he was sleepy. Then I called his best friend, stuff happened, and then I called him again. Then he picked up, then he was like, I was like, were you sleeping? He was like, yeah. I was like, you know, do you want to sleep? And then he was like, yes, of course, I want to sleep. That's why I'm sleeping. And I was like, okay, sleep. Then I talked with his best friend for a while, and then he called me. Then something, something happened. Like, he called me, I picked up, I said, I'm talking with her best friend. He's like, okay, join me. But then he left without even saying something. Then he was like, I'm going to sleep. I'm going to try and go to sleep. I was like, okay. And then I was very frustrated with all this mess. So his best friend advised me, if you're angry, just call him and just, you know, when you're angry with him, just communicate. So I called him. And after a while, he called back and I was like, you know what, do you want to talk to me or not? He was like, you want to talk to me like with this tone, please don't talk to me like don't, you know, bring your frustration from another conversation, which was not related to me and vented out on me like that kind of conversation. And then he was like, you know what, let's don't, I'm not in a mood to talk today. Let's talk tomorrow. And I was like, why you even want to talk? Let's not talk. Let's not talk any, any day. And then I was like, okay, let's not talk any day. Okay, bye. That was the conversation.
And after 12 hrs this message came from his side "Hye i am sorry for last it, it was soo rude of me to behave such inappropriately with you i hope you can forgive me for my uncalled act last night i am extremely sorry I was not in my senses".</p>
